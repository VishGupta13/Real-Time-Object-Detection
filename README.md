# Real-Time-Object-Detection
Real-time object detection is the task of doing object detection in real-time with fast inference while maintaining a base level of accuracy.

In this python project, we are going to build the Real Time Object Detection through Webcam. 

This is an intermediate level deep learning project on computer vision, which will help you to master the concepts and make you an expert in the field of Data Science.

Letâ€™s build an exciting project.

# Project Prerequisites
The project in Python requires you to have basic knowledge of python programming and the OpenCV library. We will be needing following libraries:

OpenCV(Compyuter Vision): A strong library used for machine learning

TensorFlow: Deep Learning For Model.

Numpy: Used for Scientific Computing. Image is stored in a numpy array.
# To install the required library, run the following code in your terminal.
-pip install opencv-python

-pip install tensorflow

-pip install numpy
# Models
ssdmobile net
# Data Set
Data Sets are taken from the: 
COCO 2020
# Some Important Terms: 
# frozen_inference_graph.pb
Provides the weightage average
# Flatten
It Converts the multidimensional array into 1-D Array

# SOME SCREEN SHOTS OF THE PROJECT ARE GIVEN BELOW
